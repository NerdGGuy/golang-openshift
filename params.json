{"name":"Openshift - Go","body":"How to Run Go on OpenShift\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nOpenShift is a great PaaS offering by Red Hat. At the moment \r\nGo is not currently on the supported platform list. However Red Hat \r\nhave kindly provided a DIY cartridge to run whatever you want on the \r\nplatform. As Go is one of my favourite languages I thought I'd put \r\ntogether a template that can be used to deploy a basic Go application. \r\n\r\n0. Create a OpenShift account. Go to http://openshift.redhat.com to create an account.\r\n    \r\n1. Install the OpenShift client tools. \r\n      \r\n    cd /etc/yum.repos.d  \r\n    sudo wget https://openshift.redhat.com/app/repo/openshift.repo  \r\n    sudo yum install rhc\r\n\r\n2. Create a new domain\r\n\r\n    rhc-create-domain --namespace *your-namespace* --rhlogin *your-login*\r\n\r\n3. Create a new application \r\n\r\n    rhc-create-app --app *your-appname* --type diy-0.1 --rhlogin *your-login*\r\n\r\n4. Add this as an upstream repository\r\n\r\n    git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/gcmurphy/golang-openshift.git  \r\n    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master\r\n\r\n5. Build the source and copy the output to your bin directory (updated for Go version 1)\r\n    \r\n    cd server  \r\n    go build   \r\n    mv server ../bin  \r\n\r\n5. Push to your OpenShift repository\r\n   \r\n    git commit -a -m \"My first go + openshift application\"   \r\n    git push\r\n\r\n\r\n6. You are good to Go!
